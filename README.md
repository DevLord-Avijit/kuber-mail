# üí∏ Kuber Mail 

**Kuber Mail** is a lightweight, email-driven payment gateway that lets businesses, freelancers, or anyone **accept UPI payments without needing a bank account or API integration**.

Forget the hassle of connecting to banks, handling APIs, or complex payment SDKs. Kuber Mail works by:

1. Generating **unique payment orders** with tiny fractional amounts.
2. **Scanning a configured email inbox** for partner payment notifications.
3. **Automatically matching received payments** to pending orders.

Perfect for **small businesses, freelancers, or informal services** looking for a **simple, automated, and secure payment solution**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

| Feature                       | Why It Rocks                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UPI Payments via Email**    | Track payments via email‚Äîno bank APIs required.                     |
| **Unique Fractional Amounts** | Add tiny fractions to amounts to easily distinguish payments.       |
| **QR Code Generation**        | Each order gets its own UPI QR code for instant payment scanning.   |
| **Order Tracking**            | See statuses: `PENDING`, `PAID`, `EXPIRED`.                         |
| **Automatic Expiration**      | Orders automatically expire after a set time (TTL).                 |
| **Threaded IMAP Polling**     | Continuously scans emails for payment confirmations.                |
| **Environment Configurable**  | All settings (emails, UPI IDs, limits) are configurable via `.env`. |
| **Lightweight & Portable**    | Runs on pure Python 3 with minimal dependencies.                    |

## üõ† How It Works

```text
[User] --> Create Order --> [Kuber Mail Backend]
                                |
                                v
                       Adds Fraction to Amount
                                |
                                v
                     Generates UPI QR Code & URI
                                |
                                v
                       Payer Scans QR & Pays
                                |
                                v
                     Email Notification Received
                                |
                                v
                     IMAP Polling & Payment Matching
                                |
                                v
                      Order Status Updated (PAID)
```

**Step-by-Step Flow:**

1. Create a payment order via `/create_order` or web form.
2. Kuber Mail generates the **full amount** (base + fractional).
3. A **UPI URI and QR code** are created for the payer.
4. Payer sends money via UPI.
5. Kuber Mail polls your **email inbox** using IMAP.
6. Payment emails are parsed and matched with pending orders.
7. Order status updates to `PAID`, and fractions are released for reuse.

> üí° Tip: Each fractional amount ensures you can distinguish payments even if multiple payers send the same base amount.

## üñ• Technical Backend Overview

Built in **Python 3**, Kuber Mail uses **Flask** for APIs and **IMAP scanning** for emails.

**Modules at a glance:**

| Module             | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.py`           | Main Flask app + IMAP scanner.                     |
| `orders.py`        | Manage orders (store, retrieve, update).           |
| `fractions.py`     | Handle fractional amounts for uniqueness.          |
| `qr_generator.py`  | Generate UPI URIs & QR codes.                      |
| `email_scanner.py` | Poll IMAP inbox, parse emails, and match payments. |
| `utils.py`         | Helper functions (regex, utilities, etc).          |

**Backend Highlights:**

* Threaded IMAP polling detects incoming payments in real-time.
* Orders have **unique fractional amounts**.
* All orders are stored in a JSON file (`orders.json`).
* Payments are matched automatically via **amount + payer name** regex.
* Fractions are released once payments are confirmed or orders expire.
